	I have always been interested in Technology! 
       Do you realize that we have robots running around on Mars? Did you realize that we have satellites that have gone beyond Pluto?
       And then there is what technology has done for us right here on Earth. We can replace limbs and some organs. We have self-driving cars. I think all these things are amazing! What can’t we accomplish?
       I am excited that I get to be a part of it. I would like the opportunity to build something that will one day help the human race.
